# TheCollection

## Introduction
This project aim to display a list of books I advice you to read. John Connolly is certainly, in my opinion, one of the best author of mystery and supernatural fiction.

In the same time, this page (which is only client side) allows me to sharpen my skills in JS? Html and CSS. Bootsrap was used to code the syle of the page.
